# pxls.space in Golang

Rework of the [pxls.space](https://pxls.space) (a r/Place clone) backend in Golang.

This started from the frustration of getting the original, Java version, to work; and was impulsed by other Pxls' Developers talking about a rework in either Golang or Rust.

I'm fairly new to Rust and had learned Golang a few months ago, so prefered trying to refresh what I knew about Golang instead.

With some hope (and luck), this might eventually become the live version of the game.
